# efficient_SBSR

This repository contains the Spatiotemporal B-Spline Reconstruction (SBSR) method of the Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT) algorithm with an efficient gradient calculation approach to improve speed. The code for the modified SBSR method is available in /commons, and FOV_demo.ipynb is a sample notebook comparing the speed and accuracy of the original and current algorithms.

The comparison functions in /ComparisonFunctions and PET list mode data in /data are from https://github.com/mxh1092/RoPP-Comparison-Functions.
